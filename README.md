# PANDA Challenge - Prostate Cancer Grade Assessment Project

This project aims to address the problem presented in the PANDA (Prostate CANcer graDe Assessment) Challenge, which involves automatically assessing ISUP grades based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of prostate tissue biopsies.

## Project Structure

Below is a description of the main files and directories in this project:

* **`data/`**: Directory for storing data.
    * `clean_noise.csv`: Training data label file, potentially pre-cleaned and containing K-Fold split information.
    * `train_images/` : Directory containing original `.tiff` format training images.
    * `test_images/` :  Directory containing original `.tiff` format test images.
    * `train_concatenated_png_36*256_v2/`:  Directory containing PNG images generated by `preprocess_png_to_concatenated_tiles_v2.py`, which are concatenated from 36 tiles of 256x256 pixels.

* **`dataloader.py`**: Defines PyTorch `Dataset` and `DataLoader` for loading and preprocessing data, including preparation for auxiliary task labels and color inversion.
* **`train.py`**: Script for model training. It uses `dataloader.py` to load data and trains specified models (e.g., EfficientNet-B1) with support for layer freezing, GeM pooling, and auxiliary tasks.
* **`submission.py`** (As previously provided by you, assumed to be the inference script): Used for loading trained models, making predictions on the test set, and generating the `submission.csv` file. It supports ensembling multiple models and can dynamically handle preprocessing (like color inversion) based on individual model requirements.
* **`tiff_png.py`**: Script for converting original `.tiff` format images to `.png` format. This might be the first step in data preprocessing.
* **`preprocess_png_to_concatenated_tiles.py`**: The first version of the tile extraction and concatenation script, processing PNG images into larger concatenated images.
* **`preprocess_png_to_concatenated_tiles_v2.py`**: A second or improved version of the tile extraction and concatenation script, used to create images in the `train_concatenated_png_36*256_v2/` directory.
